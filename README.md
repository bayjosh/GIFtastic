This app allows users to view a selection of sports GIFs by clicking pre-selected buttons, or by adding their own. Users can set the gifs in motion by clicking on them individually, and pause them by clicking again. Each button creates a search in Giphy's database using Giphy's API for on-theme images and presents them on the screen.
